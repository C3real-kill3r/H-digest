Watch the ncpwd repositories for issues or pull request you could help with! When you encounter a bug/have an idea for a feature/encounter missing documentation that could easily be fixed, create first-timers-only issues like this ones for people wanting to make their first OSS contribution! If you need help creating this sort of issue, please ping @YAHYA-H or @C3real-kill3r in Github Contribute To The Community! Write blog posts! Help us contribute to our existing documentation and write new documentation! You can find links to each app\u2019s/starter project\u2019s documentation in the README of the app/starter project. Write tutorials and show others how to use it, what features it has, etc. Contribute Code! Write tests! If you have time to fix any of our GitHub issues (especially those labelled up-for-grabs ) we would greatly appreciate your help! Create a new starter project which showcases how to use any of our NCPWD apps (or a combination of them). This doesn\u2019t have to be anything new or original.

Problem Statement The National Council of People Living with Disabilities (NCPWD), is a corporation mandated to formulate and implement policies that are geared towards mainstreaming Persons with disabilities into the national economy. In line with the councils objectives, the council carries out various activities which heavily relies on interaction with people with disabilities. Proposed flow of information The application will be divided into two platforms, android and web. The web application will be used by the administrators to convey messages and view statistics to help in critical decision making. The android application(android version 4.0+) will be used by the PWD to engage with one another and also receive regular updates from the administrators. Data will be updated by the council through the web application that will sync with the mobile application as well as the data currently held in the council databases. Objectives of the application To Public Showcase ongoing and past event activies that the council has engaged in. Enhance awareness and social networking among PWD's through the custom made android app. Allow tailored messages to reach specific people as will be required by the council in carrying out their mandate. Notify PWD's if they have upcoming functions in their area through location based profiling. To Administrators Provide detailed tailored information about persons with disabilities. Allow viewing summary data on people registered with disabilities on the go. Allow sending tailored push notifications and message to PWD's Advantages of the platform to PWDs They would be abled to get tailored data directly to their phones. The data could range from their registration details, upcoming assesments or events coming close to them. The android app will have provide a social avenue allowing them to be in contact with each other. This will increase social awareness and networking among PWDs. The mobile app would increase visibility of NCPWD. It would be easier to engage with persons with disabilities on the go through push notifications directly to their phones. Most importantly they'll be able to receive information on the go.
