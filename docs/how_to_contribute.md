# How To Contribute

If you would like to help others who are just starting to contribute to NCPWD, you can do the following:

* Hang out in [Slack]() and help answer questions!
* Watch the [ncpwd  repositories](https://github.com/C3real-kill3r/NCPWD) for issues or pull request you could help with!
* When you encounter a bug/have an idea for a feature/encounter missing documentation that could easily be fixed, create `first-timers-only` issues like [this ones](https://github.com/C3real-kill3r/NCPWD/issues/) for people wanting to make their first OSS contribution! If you need help creating this sort of issue, please ping @YAHYA-H or @C3real-kill3r in Github


## Contribute To The Community!

* Write blog posts!
* Help us contribute to our existing documentation and write new documentation! You can find links to each app’s/starter project’s documentation in the README of the app/starter project.
* Write tutorials and show others how to use it, what features it has, etc.

## Contribute Code!
* Write tests!
* If you have time to fix any of our GitHub issues (especially those labelled `up-for-grabs`) we would greatly appreciate your help!
* Create a new starter project which showcases how to use any of our NCPWD apps (or a combination of them). This doesn’t have to be anything new or original.
* Give us your feedbacks, let us know about your idea how to improve this app.
